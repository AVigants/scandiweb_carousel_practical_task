# scandiweb_carousel_practical_task
This is a Carousel component made in react without the use of 'create-react-app'

# How to initialize the project:
// Clone this repo
// in the terminal, go to the repo and 'npm i' the dependencies
// 'npm run start'

# How to use the component:
// import the 'Carousel.js' component in your designated App or any other component
// In the render block (or 'return' block if you're not using a class based component) add the <Carousel/> template and nest your content in between the opening and closing <Component/> tags.
// The component will perform its functions based on the props.children it receives.

In this project, I have used premade Panels that can be found in src/components/Panels. Feel free to adjust them or add panels of your own. The styles for the Panels can be found in the src/index.css file.
